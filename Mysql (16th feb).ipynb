    "1.What is a database? differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "     A database is a organized collection of data that can be accessed,managed,and updated.Databases are used to store and organize data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and manipulate the information they contain.There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SQL databases,also known as relational databases,store data in tables with predefined columns and rows.The use a structured query languages(SQL) to interact with the data.SQL databases are best suited for applications where the data has a well-defined structure,such as financial applications or invertory management systems.Examples of SQL databases include MySQL,PostgresSQL,Oracle,and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    NoSQL databases,do not use tables with predefined columns and rows.They store data in a variety of ways,such as key-value pairs,documents-oriented databases,and graph databases.NoSQL databases are best suited for applications where the data is unstructured or semi-structured,such as social media,big data,and real-time analytics.\n",
    "    Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB,Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    NoSQL databases are better suited for real-time applications,SQL databases also typically have better support for transactions and data integrity,While NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable.\n",
    "    The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of the application and data being stored.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.What is DDL? EXplain why CREATE,DROP,ALTER ,and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "    Ans-\n",
    "        DDL stands for Data Defintion Language,which is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of databases and database objects.DDL statements are used to create,modify,and delete database objects.DDL statements are used to create,modify,and delete database objects such as tables,indexes, and constraints.\n",

    "                2.DROP:This statemnet is used to delete an existing database object,such as a table or index.For example-the following statement drops the \"employees\"table:\n",

    "                3.ALTER:This statement is used to modify an existing database  object,such as table or column.For example,the following statement adds a new column called\"dapartment\"to the \"employees\"table:\n",
