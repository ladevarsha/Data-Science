    "Q1. What is the mathematical formula for a linear SVM?\n",

    "Ans-\n",

    "Q3. What is the kernel trick in SVM?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    The kernel trick is a technique used in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to transform non-linearly separable data into a higher-dimensional feature space where it can be more easily separated by a linear classifier. It allows SVMs to efficiently classify complex datasets that would be difficult to classify using a linear classifier in the original input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the kernel trick, we use a kernel function to compute the dot product between two feature vectors in a higher-dimensional space without actually computing the coordinates of the vectors in that space. This allows us to compute the decision boundary in the higher-dimensional space without actually computing the coordinates of the data points in that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used kernel functions are the linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel. The choice of kernel function depends on the nature of the data and the complexity of the decision boundary needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel trick allows SVMs to learn non-linear decision boundaries in a computationally efficient way. It avoids the computational burden of explicitly computing the coordinates of the data points in a higher-dimensional space by using the kernel function to compute the dot product directly in the original input space. This allows the SVM to scale to large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces."

    "Q4. What is the role of support vectors in SVM Explain with example\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    In Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) and have a non-zero weight in the solution vector. They play a crucial role in determining the decision boundary and the margin of the SVM classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vectors define the margin of the SVM classifier, which is the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data points from each class. The SVM classifier tries to maximize this margin by finding the hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes with the maximum margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vectors also help to generalize the SVM classifier to new, unseen data. This is because the decision boundary of the SVM classifier is defined only by the support vectors, and not by all the training data points. The SVM classifier is therefore less sensitive to noise and outliers in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a binary classification problem where we have two classes of data points that are not linearly separable in 2D input space. By applying a kernel function, we can map the data points into a higher-dimensional feature space where they are more likely to be linearly separable. We can then use an SVM classifier to find the hyperplane that separates the two classes with the maximum margin. The support vectors in this case are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and have a non-zero weight in the solution vector. These support vectors define the decision boundary and the margin of the SVM classifier, and they play a crucial role in determining the performance of the classifier."
