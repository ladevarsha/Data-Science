    "Que 1: Name any five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library. Also, state the uses of each plot.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "     Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. Here are five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library, along with their uses:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1.Scatter plot - A scatter plot is a graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along two axes, allowing us to see if there is any relationship between them. It is useful for identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2.Line plot - A line plot is a graph that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. It is useful for visualizing trends in data over time or to show the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3.Bar plot - A bar plot is a graph that uses rectangular bars to represent data. It is useful for comparing values across categories and identifying the highest or lowest values in a dataset.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4.Histogram - A histogram is a graph that shows the distribution of a dataset. It is useful for identifying the shape of the data, including whether it is skewed, symmetrical, or bimodal.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5.Heatmap - A heatmap is a graphical representation of data in which values are represented as colors. It is useful for visualizing relationships between variables and identifying patterns in large datasets, especially when there are many variables."
