    "1.what is Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Ans- An exception is an event,which occurs duringthe execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.In general,when python encounters a situation that it cannot cope with,it raises an exception,An exception is a python object that represents an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both exception and errors are the subclasses of a throwable class. The error implies the problem that mostly arises due to the shortage of system resources.on the other hand exception occur during runtime and complile time."
