    "Ans -\n",
    "      Mechanism that allows mutiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process.A thread is a separate flow of execution within a program, and muiltithreading allows for parallelism and concurrency, making it possible to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",

    "    In other words,each thread is blocked and waiting for a resource that another thread is holding, and the program becomes stuck in a state where no progress can be made.Deadlocks are serious problem in multithreaded programs and can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Race condition:A race condition occurs when the behaviour of a program depends on the relatives timing and interleaving of events between two or more threads.\n",
    "    In other words,the outcome of the program can vary depending on the order in which the threads execute.This can lead to predictable or incorrect behaviour,such as data corruption or incorrect program results.Race conditions can occurs when multiple threads access and modify shared resources without proper synchronization or mutual exclusion,leading to data inconsistency and errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To avoid deadlocks and race condtions in multithreaded programs,it is important to follow best practices such as proper synchronization and mutual exclusion,careful design and testing,and using appropriate concurrency libraries and tools.\n",
