    "Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans-  A DataFrame in pandas is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table, where data is organized in rows and columns, and each column can have a different data type. A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Series objects, where each Series represents a column of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series in pandas, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional labeled data structure with a homogeneous data type.\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a Pandas Series\n",
    "s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",

    "# create a Pandas DataFrame\n",

    "print(df)\n",
