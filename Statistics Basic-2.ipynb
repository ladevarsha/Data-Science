    "1.Mean: The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. It is sensitive to outliers or extreme values in the data set. In other words, if there are some values that are very different from the rest of the data, the mean will be affected by these values. The mean is often used when the data set has a normal or symmetrical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in order. It is less sensitive to outliers or extreme values in the data set compared to the mean. The median is often used when the data set has a skewed distribution.\n",

    "3.Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is used when we want to know which value occurs most often in a data set. The mode is often used in categorical data or data that can only take certain values.\n",

    "In general, the choice of central tendency measure to use depends on the nature of the data and the research question being asked. If the data is normally distributed, the mean is usually the best measure of central tendency. If the data is skewed, the median may be a better choice. If the data is categorical, the mode may be the most appropriate measure of central tendency."

    "    Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread of a dataset by quantifying how much the data values deviate from the central tendency of the data (i.e., the mean, median, or mode). A higher value of dispersion measures indicates that the data values are more spread out from the central tendency, while a lower value indicates that the data values are more closely clustered around the central tendency.\n",

    "Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. For Dataset 1, the variance is 50, while for Dataset 2, the variance is 100/3 ≈ 33.33. The larger variance for Dataset 2 indicates that the data values are more spread out from the mean compared to Dataset 1.\n",

A skewed dataset is one where the distribution is not symmetric, and it is either skewed to the left or skewed to the right.\n",
