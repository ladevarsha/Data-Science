    "a suitable type of time series model for forecasting future sales would be the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. SARIMA extends the ARIMA model by incorporating seasonality.\n",

    "\n",
    "Extrapolation uncertainty: Time series models make forecasts based on patterns observed in historical data.\n",
