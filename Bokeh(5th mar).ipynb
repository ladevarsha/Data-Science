    "Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    Distplot is a type of plot that combines a histogram and a density plot, providing a visual representation of the distribution of a numerical variable. In Plotly Express, the distplot function is used to create distplots. Here's an example of how to use the distplot function to plot a distplot using the \"total_bill\" column of the \"tips\" dataset:\n",
    "    \n",
    "import plotly.express as px\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the tips dataset from Plotly Express\n",
    "tips_df = px.data.tips()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a distplot using Plotly Express\n",
    "fig = px.histogram(tips_df, x='total_bill', nbins=20, opacity=0.7, color_discrete_sequence=['blue'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a density curve to the distplot\n",
    "fig.update_traces(histnorm='density', rug=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a distplot using the px.histogram function from Plotly Express. The \"total_bill\" column is used as the x parameter, and the number of bins is set to 20 using the nbins parameter. The opacity parameter sets the transparency of the bars in the histogram, and the color_discrete_sequence parameter sets the color of the bars. The histnorm parameter is set to \"density\" to add a density curve to the distplot, and the rug parameter is set to True to add rug marks along the x-axis. The resulting plot shows the distribution of total bills in the tips dataset, with a density curve overlaid on top of the histogram.   "

    "Q.2 What are glyphs in Bokeh, and how can you add them to a Bokeh plot? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    n Bokeh, glyphs are the basic visual elements that are used to display data on a plot. Glyphs are geometrical shapes such as circles, squares, lines, and rectangles that are used to represent the data points on the plot. Bokeh provides a variety of glyph types that can be customized with various visual properties like size, color, and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add glyphs to a Bokeh plot, you can use one of the many glyph functions provided by the bokeh.plotting module. These functions take in data and visual properties as arguments and return a glyph renderer object that can be added to the plot. The most commonly used glyph functions are:\n",

    "    Bokeh provides several ways to customize the appearance of a plot, including the axes, title, and legend. Here are some ways to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Customize the title: You can set the title of a plot using the title property of the figure object. For example, p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\" sets the title of the plot to \"My Bokeh Plot\". You can also customize the font size and style of the title using the text_font_size and text_font_style properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Customize the axes: You can customize the appearance of the x and y axes using the xaxis and yaxis properties of the figure object. For example, p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X Label\" sets the label of the x-axis to \"X Label\". You can also customize the font size, style, tick labels, and range of the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Customize the legend: You can customize the appearance of the legend using the legend property of the figure object. For example, p.legend.location = \"top_left\" sets the location of the legend to the top left corner of the plot. You can also customize the font size, style, and layout of the legend.\n",
