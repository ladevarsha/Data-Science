    "Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.\n",
    "In linear algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are properties of square matrices. An eigenvector of a matrix is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by the matrix, results in a scalar multiple of itself. The scalar multiple is known as the eigenvalue, and the eigenvector is said to be an eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n",

This can be useful in solving systems of linear equations, identifying important features in a dataset, and for transformations in image processing.

    "The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be understood in the context of linear transformations. For a given matrix A, its eigenvectors represent the directions in which the linear transformation represented by A scales space. The eigenvalues represent the factor by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk by the transformation.\n",

If an eigenvalue is positive, the corresponding eigenvector is stretched by the transformation, while if it is negative, the eigenvector is shrunk.
