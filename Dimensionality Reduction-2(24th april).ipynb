    "Dimensionality reduction: PCA is widely used for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while preserving important patterns and relationships. \n",

    "Noise filtering: PCA can help identify and remove noise from data by reconstructing the data using a reduced number of principal components. \n",

    "PCA handles data with high variance in some dimensions but low variance in others by emphasizing the dimensions with high variance during the dimensionality reduction process. \n",
    "The principal components are determined based on the directions of maximum variance in the data. \n",
    "If certain dimensions have high variance, they will contribute more to the overall variance and be prioritized in the principal components.\n",

    "In this scenario, PCA will effectively capture the high-variance dimensions as the leading principal components\n",
    "while the dimensions with low variance will have relatively smaller contributions. \n",
    "This allows PCA to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data by discarding dimensions with low variance\n",
    "while retaining the most important information contained in the dimensions with high variance.\n",
    "The low-variance dimensions will have less impact on the final representation, which helps to focus on the most informative aspects of the data."
