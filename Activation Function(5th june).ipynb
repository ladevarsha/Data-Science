    " \n",
    " An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical function that introduces non-linearity into the output of a neuron or node. It determines whether the neuron should be activated or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs and a bias. The activation function adds non-linear properties to the network, enabling it to learn and approximate complex patterns in the data."

    "- Gradient Flow: The choice of activation function affects the gradient flow during backpropagation, which influences how effectively the network can learn and update its weights.\n",
