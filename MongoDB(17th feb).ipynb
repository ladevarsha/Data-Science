    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans- \n",
    "    MongoDB is a popular document-based NoSQL database that is designed to be highly scalable and flexible. It is an open-source database that stores data in a document format using JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, which means that fields can vary from document to document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, differ from traditional relational databases in that they do not use a tabular structure to store data. Instead, they use different data models like document-based, key-value, graph, or column-family to store data. This makes NoSQL databases more flexible and scalable, especially for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, which is difficult to store in the structured format of relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexibility: MongoDB allows developers to work with semi-structured and unstructured data easily, which makes it more flexible than SQL databases, where the data must be modeled into a strict schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally, which makes it easy to scale up to handle large amounts of data or traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Performance: MongoDB can provide better performance than SQL databases, especially for read-intensive workloads or when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.High availability: MongoDB provides features like replica sets and sharding, which helps to ensure high availability and prevent data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Real-time analytics: MongoDB can provide real-time analytics on large datasets, which can be helpful for businesses that need to make data-driven decisions quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is preferred in scenarios where there is a need for flexibility, scalability, performance, high availability, and real-time analytics."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "     MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that offers several features that set it apart from traditional relational databases. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexible data model: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents. This makes it easy to store and query complex hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scale-out architecture: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling, which means that it can easily scale out across multiple servers or nodes. This makes it easy to handle large volumes of data and high levels of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Indexing: MongoDB supports secondary indexes, which can be used to improve query performance. It also supports a variety of index types, including single-field, multi-field, and geospatial indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Aggregation framework: MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data processing on your collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, which means that you can query your data without having to define a schema or structure beforehand. This makes it easy to work with dynamic and evolving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Automatic sharding: MongoDB can automatically partition your data across multiple servers or nodes, which makes it easy to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Replication and high availability: MongoDB supports automatic replication, which means that you can easily create redundant copies of your data. This provides high availability and helps ensure that your application remains up and running in the event of a failure.\n"
