    "Q1. What is boosting in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    Boosting is a type of ensemble learning technique in machine learning, where multiple weak learners (classifiers or regressors) are combined to create a stronger learner. Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model is trained to improve the weaknesses of the previous models. In boosting, each new model focuses on the instances that the previous models have not predicted correctly, and the final prediction is a weighted sum of the predictions of all the models. The objective of boosting is to reduce the bias and variance of the final model and improve its overall performance.\n",

This allows the algorithm to focus more on the samples that are difficult to classify. Specifically, the weights of misclassified samples are increased by multiplying them by a factor of (1 / beta), where beta is the error rate of the weak learner. The weights of correctly classified samples are decreased by multiplying them by a factor of (beta / (1 - beta)). This way, the weights of misclassified samples are increased while the weights of correctly classified samples are decreased, leading to a better overall performance of the algorithm."

This is because increasing the number of estimators allows the algorithm to fit the data more closely, which reduces the errors caused by underfitting. However, there is a tradeoff between the number of estimators and the complexity of the model, so increasing the number of estimators beyond a certain point may lead to overfitting and decreased performance on new data."
