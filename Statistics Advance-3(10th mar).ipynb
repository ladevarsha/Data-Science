    "There are two types of estimates in estimation statistics: point estimates and interval estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Point Estimate: A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. Point estimates are based on sample statistics and provide an estimate of the population parameter value. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean.\n",

    "2.Interval Estimate: An interval estimate is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence. Interval estimates are based on a range of values and provide a more accurate estimate of the population parameter than point estimates. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean is an interval estimate that provides a range of values likely to contain the true value of the population mean with a 95% level of confidence.\n",
