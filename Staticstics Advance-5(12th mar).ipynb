    "The null hypothesis is that chocolate preference and country of origin are independent, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant association between them. The chi-square test statistic is 33.98, and the p-value is very small (less than 0.01). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between chocolate preference and country of origin. The expected frequencies show that if chocolate preference and country of origin were independent, we would expect to see roughly equal proportions of people from the U.S. and the U.K. who prefer milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate. However, the observed frequencies suggest that there are some differences between the two countries. For example, a larger proportion of people from the U.S. prefer milk chocolate compared to people from the U.K. This provides evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference in chocolate preference between the U.S. and the U.K.\n",
