    "Q1. What is meant by time-dependent seasonal components?\n",
    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to patterns in time series data that exhibit seasonality, where the seasonal patterns can vary over time. \n",
    "In other words, the magnitude or shape of the seasonal fluctuations in the data changes as time progresses. \n",
    "This variation in seasonal patterns can be observed in various time scales, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles.\n",
