    "Ans-\n",
    "    Probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF describes the relative likelihood of the values of the random variable occurring within a given interval. It is a non-negative function, and the area under the curve of the PDF over an interval gives the probability of the variable taking values in that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is defined as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable. In other words, if F(x) is the CDF of the random variable X, then the PDF f(x) is defined as:\n",
